# face-detection

<br>
Introduction
<br>
Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualize human faces in digital 
images. This technique is a specific use case of object detection technology that deals with 
detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings or cars) in 
digital images and videos. With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a lot of 
importance especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing.

Innovation Idea of Project
<br>
1. It can Detect faces easily with less time of execution. 
2. It can Detect Face in any quality of Images even blur. 
3. It can Detect single, double or even multiple faces in any Image. 
4. It use Haar feature based Algorithm to detect which it makes very accurate and fast 
processing of face detection.

Scope of Project
<br>
To identify and verify terrorists at airports, railway stations and malls the face recognition technology will be the best 
choice in India as compared with other biometric technologies since other technologies cannot be helpful in crowded 
places. 
This technology can also be used effectively in various important examinations such as SSC, HSC, Medical, 
Engineering, MCA, MBA, B- Pharmacy, Nursing courses etc. The examinee can be identified and verified using 
Face Recognition Technique. 
It can also be deployed in police station to identify and verify the criminals. 
To Identify the Number of student in classroom. It can collect in all the number of faces in less than 1 sec. Easy to 
take attendance

OpenCV-Python
<br>

OpenCV essentially stands for Open Source Computer Vision Library. Although it is written in optimized C/C++, 
it has interfaces for Python and Java along with C++. OpenCV boasts of an active user base all over the world with its use 
increasing day by day due to the surge in computer vision applications. 
OpenCV-Python is the python API for OpenCV. You can think of it as a python wrapper around the C++ implementation of 
OpenCV. OpenCV-Python is not only fast (since the background consists of code written in C/C++) but is also easy to 
code and deploy(due to the Python wrapper in foreground). This makes it a great choice to perform computationally 
intensive programs

Haar feature-based cascade classifiers
<br>
Haar-like features are digital image features used in object recognition. They owe their name to their intuitive similarity with 
Haar wavelets and were used in the first real-time face detector. Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper titled "Rapid 
Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" used the idea of Haar-feature classifier based on the Haar 
wavelets. 
This classifier is widely used for tasks like face detection in computer vision industry. 
Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effectual machine learning based approach, in which a cascade function is trained 
using a sample that contains a lot of positive and negative images. The outcome of AdaBoost classifier is that the strong 
classifiers are divided into stages to form cascade classifiers.
